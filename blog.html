          <b>Answer:</b> If any Veriable is declared with Var then that Veriable
          Can also be used outside the scope, which is also called Global Veriable, and that Veriable can be declared repeatedly. which before we declare
          If you want to use it shows undefined but does not give error. But let and
          Const cannot be used more than once as a Veriable name.
          Error kills when doing. And the difference between let and Const
          Its value cannot be changed after declaring a const .property
          Value can be changed. But let is a bit independent, to declare
          Value of Veriable can be changed directly.

          2. Q: What is the difference between Array function and Regular function?

          Answer: The difference between regular function and Array function is that like first with this, regular function has its own this which can be captured with parameters. But the Array function has no this of its own. Although this works if given, it assumes the entire global.

            and syntax

            
            //  Regular Function
            function regular(){
                console.log('regularFunction');
                return 'lol';
            }
            // Array Function
            const array = ()=> console.log('regularFunction');
            

            Regular function should start with function and should be written between curly brackets and return keyword should be used to return.

            Array function, Veriable name has to be declared and started with the expression where if there is 1 parameter, the first bracket works even if the first bracket is not given, and especially if you want to return, if it is a function in one line, then it returns as if it does not need to be returned. And Array function is also called flat function.

          Answer: map, forEach, filter, find all of them work with Array.

          map is an Array that holds each element and works with all of them separately. And all final results can be returned.

          forEach same of map but can't just return like map.

          A filter is an Array that holds each element and separates each of the **conditions**.
          works through And all final results can be returned.

          find is like filter but Array holds each element **matching the condition**
          Remove the rest. And all final results can be returned.

          Answer: template string's interesting function is that the web page can be displayed dynamically, and to display any text on different lines, a lot of code needs to be written which can be written very easily with template string.
